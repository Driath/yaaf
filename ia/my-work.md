# My Work

Personal work items backlog. Read by agent when `TODO.md` is empty.

## Active

<!-- Items you're currently working on -->

## Backlog

<!-- Items to pick up next -->

## Sources

Work items can be synced from external sources:

| Source | Integration | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Jira | `mcp:atlassian` | KAN-* issues assigned to me |
| GitHub | `gh issue list` | Issues assigned to me |
| Manual | Edit this file | Ad-hoc tasks |

## Notes

- Agent reads this when `TODO.md` has no pending tasks
- Keep items actionable and scoped
- Move completed items to project's `TODO.md` as done
