## Skills to Implement/Improve

### skill:check
- [x] Read `skill:format:out` dynamically (DRY design-system)
- [x] Validate Output section against format
- [x] Add `--all` to validate all skills
- [x] Generate/update `ia/state/skills.md`
- [x] Encourage E2E testing in notes

### workflow:check
- [x] Create `workflow:check` skill (V1)
- [x] Inherit from skill:check (workflow IS skill)
- [x] Validate sub-skills exist
- [x] Generate/update `ia/state/workflows.md`
- [x] V2: Validate sub-skills are themselves validated (read `ia/state/skills.md`)
- [x] V2: Call `skill:check` on each sub-skill (deep validation)

## State Files

- [x] `ia/state/skills.md` - generated by `skill:check --all`
- [x] `ia/state/workflows.md` - generated by `workflow:check --all`


## Cleanup

- [x] Remove "Background Monitoring" rule from `workflow/SKILL.md` (not its responsibility)
